This is our Second Sprint for Mobile Prototyping at Olin College by Rachel Biniaz, Doyung Lee, and Aidan McLaughlin.

The basis for our app comes from Rachel's idea to formalize the "Olin Challenge" which is 'lost' when two Oliners run into
each other by chance anywhere that isn't Olin.

Our goal is to get alumni involvement and promote this app as a tool with which Oliners past and present can keep up with 
each other, including parents and other members of the community.
